## Detailed Notes on Real-Time Timer Implementation üìù

### Introduction üé¨
- The tutorial video covers real-time timer implementation, diving deep into its APIs and internal functioning.
- Provides a real-world example of how to use a real-time timer in an application.

### Internal Functioning ü§ñ
1. **Real Timer Element**: The core data structure representing an event.
    - **Components**:
        1. **Time Interval**: Time after which event should trigger.
        2. **Rotation Number (Small R-value)**: Number of rotations after which event should trigger.
        3. **Function Pointer**: Holds address of function to be invoked.
        4. **Argument**: Argument to be supplied to the function.
        5. **Argument Size**: Size of the argument.
        6. **Reference**: Boolean indicating if the event is recurring (1) or one-off (0).
    - **Application Callback**: It's a function pointer with specific signature `void* (void*, int)`.

2. **API for Event Registration**: `API_Register_App_Event`
    - **Arguments**:
        - Real timer object
        - Event function pointer
        - Event function argument and size
        - Time interval
        - Recurring or one-off flag

### Writing an Application Using Real Timer üìú
1. **Step 1**: In the `main` function, create a real timer object and start it.
2. **Step 2**: Create the application's routine and its wrapper function. The wrapper adapts the routine to the expected signature.
3. **Step 3**: Use `API_Register_App_Event` to register the event with the real timer.

### Execution and Output üñ•Ô∏è
- After registration, the real timer calls the wrapper function with the arguments every 5 seconds (in this example) indefinitely.

### Compilation & Execution üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Instructions for compilation and execution are in the README file.
- Real-world example of printing strings ("Udemy" and "my string") at different intervals shows the functionality and efficiency of the real-time timer.

## Interview Questions and Answers ‚ùìüí°

### Q1: Can you explain the data structure `Real_Timer_Element` and its components?
#### A1:
The `Real_Timer_Element` data structure is crucial for representing an event in the real timer system. It consists of the following components:
1. **Time Interval**: Specifies the time after which the event should be triggered.
2. **Rotation Number (Small R-value)**: Defines the number of rotations of the real timer when the event should be triggered.
3. **Function Pointer**: Holds the address of the function that should be invoked when the event triggers.
4. **Argument**: An argument that will be passed to the function when invoked.
5. **Argument Size**: Specifies the size of the argument.
6. **Reference**: A Boolean value; if set to 1, the event is recurring, and if 0, it triggers only once.

### Q2: What is the role of the `API_Register_App_Event`?
#### A2:
The `API_Register_App_Event` API is responsible for registering an event with the real-time timer. It takes multiple arguments like the real timer object, event function pointer, function argument, argument size, time interval, and a flag to indicate if the event is recurring or one-off. The API essentially places the `Real_Timer_Element` in the appropriate slot list of the real timer.

### Q3: How does the wrapper function work in the application?
#### A3:
The wrapper function acts as an adapter between the application routine and the real timer. It adapts the signature of the application's routine to the signature expected by the real timer. Inside the wrapper function, the original arguments for the application routine are extracted and passed along when calling it.

### Q4: How do you prevent the main thread from terminating in your example application?
#### A4:
In the example application, the main thread is prevented from terminating by placing a blocking call at the end, like `scanf` or `getchar`. This is important because if the main thread terminates, the thread created by `API_Start_Will_Timer` would also terminate, stopping the real timer.

### Q5: Can the real timer handle multiple events simultaneously?
#### A5:
Yes, the real timer can handle multiple events. In the example, two strings "Udemy" and "my string" are printed at intervals of 3 seconds and 5 seconds respectively, demonstrating that the real timer can schedule and execute multiple events simultaneously.
